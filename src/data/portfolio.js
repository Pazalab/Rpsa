       intro: "New Lamu Haven is a beautifully curated Swahili-themed restaurant and retreat, crafted to capture the timeless charm of the East African coast while offering a fresh, modern dining experience. The architecture pays homage to traditional Swahili aesthetics, embracing carved woodwork, coral stone textures, lattice screens, and soft archways, all artfully blended with creative spatial design.",
       description: ["Every corner of New Lamu Haven evokes a sense of place, transporting guests into a serene coastal escape. From its cool, shaded verandahs to the intricately detailed interiors, the restaurant is more than a place to eat, it's a cultural experience infused with warmth, creativity, and a deep appreciation for Lamu’s architectural legacy.", "New Lamu Haven was envisioned as a refined, soulful space—a haven where architecture, cuisine, and culture come together in harmony. Rooted in tradition yet tailored for contemporary hospitality, it serves as both a culinary destination and a celebration of Swahili architectural identity. It is a place where time slows down, sunlight dances through latticed walls, and every meal is served with the soul of the coast. The result is a restaurant experience that is immersive, heartfelt, and uniquely Lamu."],
